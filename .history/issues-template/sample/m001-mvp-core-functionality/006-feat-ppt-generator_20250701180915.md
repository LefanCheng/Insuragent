git# Title
Build the PPTX File Generation Service (Hybrid Mode)

# Introduction
Create a backend service that generates a downloadable PPTX file. For the MVP, we will use a hybrid approach to balance user value and technical complexity: editable text content in native PPTX format, with complex visuals generated as high-resolution images.

# Tasks
- [ ] Choose a library for PPTX generation (python-pptx) and set up development environment
- [ ] Create the master slide templates (Title, Timeline, Data Growth, etc.) based on the insuragent_lora_showcase.html design
- [ ] (Editable Text): Implement a function that populates all text content (titles, descriptions, bullet points) into native PPTX text boxes. This ensures all text is fully editable by the user
- [ ] (Image-based Visuals): For complex visuals like charts and diagrams (e.g., the timeline, growth chart, split diagram), implement a separate backend service (e.g., using Matplotlib, Plotly, or a headless browser with a JS charting library) to generate these as high-resolution PNG images
- [ ] Implement a function to insert these generated images into the appropriate placeholders on the slides
- [ ] Create an API endpoint that orchestrates this hybrid process and returns the final PPTX file for download
- [ ] Implement slide layout management to ensure consistent visual hierarchy
- [ ] Add brand styling (colors, fonts, logos) to match insuragent_lora_showcase.html design
- [ ] Implement file size optimization to ensure downloads are fast and reliable
- [ ] Create error handling for image generation failures
- [ ] Write tests to validate PPTX file structure and content accuracy

# Dependencies
