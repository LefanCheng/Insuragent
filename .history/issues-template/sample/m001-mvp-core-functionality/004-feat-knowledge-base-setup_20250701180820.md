# Title
Set up the Core Knowledge Base for AI

# Introduction
Digitize and structure our two core personas and their FAB-P scripts into a format that the RAG system can query (e.g., a vector database or structured JSON files). This knowledge base is the "brain" that enables AI to generate personalized sales narratives.

# Tasks
- [ ] Create a structured JSON file for the "Urban Young Professional (Alan)" persona, including their analysis framework and FAB-P scripts
- [ ] Create a structured JSON file for the "New Parent Family (Lora)" persona, including their analysis framework and FAB-P scripts
- [ ] Implement the four-layer analysis framework: Objective Tags -> Archetype -> Pain Points -> Solution Needs
- [ ] Set up vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) for semantic search of knowledge base
- [ ] Implement a backend service to load and query this knowledge base based on input tags (e.g., #子女教育金)
- [ ] Create knowledge base management API for future updates and additions
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for frequently accessed knowledge base queries
- [ ] Write tests to validate knowledge base retrieval accuracy
- [ ] Create knowledge base versioning system for tracking changes
