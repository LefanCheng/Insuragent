# Title
Build a High-Precision PDF Parser for "GPMP3"

# Introduction
This is a critical module. Develop a backend service that specifically parses the "Global Power Multi-Currency Plan 3" proposal PDF and extracts key data into a structured JSON format. Accuracy must be 100% as this data drives the entire AI generation process.

# Tasks
- [ ] Research and choose a suitable PDF parsing library (PyMuPDF vs PDFPlumber comparison)
- [ ] Analyze the structure of the sample PDF (詹利强夫婦_保险建议书.pdf) to identify data coordinates and table structures
- [ ] Implement a function to extract header information (client name, age, premium, payment period, currency)
- [ ] Implement a function to parse the main benefits table, extracting all yearly values (guaranteed, non-guaranteed, total)
- [ ] Create a robust error handling mechanism for cases where the PDF format is unexpected
- [ ] Implement data validation to ensure extracted values are reasonable and complete
- [ ] Create a structured JSON output format for downstream AI processing
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the parser's accuracy against known sample files
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring for parser performance and error tracking
- [ ] Create a PDF format validation service to ensure only correct proposal types are processed

# Dependencies
- [ ] {DEP-001} PDF parsing library selection and installation
